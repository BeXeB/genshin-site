  "description": "An obsidian talisman that houses a Wayob Manifestation.\nIt consists of a jade idol figurine encased in obsidian. They say that in the past, people often used such figurines to attempt to communicate directly with the Wayob of the Night Kingdom. Perhaps this also explains why the Wayob can dwell within it and manifest itself in physical form.",
