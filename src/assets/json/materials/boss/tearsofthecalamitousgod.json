The gesture here is in the shape of the baleful Eye of Stormy Judgment.\nSince they are able to bring down curse and catastrophe alike with a mere gaze, it might seem natural to blame life's misfortunes on calamitous deities. However, if you think about it a little harder, if your will is strong enough, and if your convictions are firm enough...\nThe catastrophes go on for too long. Even a baleful gaze must wash itself with tears.",
