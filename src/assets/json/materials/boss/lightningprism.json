  "description": "An Electro Hypostasis channels nearby elemental energy to repair damaged elemental entities. Contains the essence of Electro energy.\nAn ordinary prism separates white light into its component colors; a Lightning Prism, however, channels flowing energies and weaves them into lightning.
